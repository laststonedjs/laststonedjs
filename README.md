# A Big Compiled Greeting! 👋 
## I'm Filip, Web & Mobile Developer 

### Merge With Bio Branch 🎯

I am extremely hard working, committed to efficiency and results. Successfully identified, diagnosed and fixed website issues. Resolved web app issues based on external and internal reports. <br/> Help to achieve a consistent look and visual theme across the website by building modern & contemporary UI solutions, finding creative functional solutions for clients through analysis and recognition issues in development. 
<br/> Personal growth and learning is one of my core driving forces. 

My greatest love & passion was and will remain for  ```JavaScript```, in general technologies related to JS , but the desire to progress and learn new techs is also a card I play. I have a short experience in working with ```.Net``` and ```Java```.

```ruby
Passionate about tech, product, and sharing knowledge through a healthy and instructive form of community.
