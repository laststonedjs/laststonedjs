# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Filip, <br/> Web Developer

I am extremely hard working, committed to efficiency and results. Successfully identified, diagnosed and fixed website issues. Resolved web app issues based on external and internal reports. <br/> Help to achieve a consistent look and visual theme across the website by building modern & contemporary UI solutions, finding creative functional solutions for clients through analysis and recognition issues in development.
